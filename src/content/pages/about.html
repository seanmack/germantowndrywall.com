      <h2 class="cs-title">Our Legacy</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        In July of 1954, Bill McEvoy and his young family left Ireland and moved
        to the United States. Bill quickly found work in the drywall industry,
        eventually starting his own drywall company.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        His son Kieran grew up in the drywall business, learning the trade from
        his father. Kieran taught his sons the same way. Today, McEvoy Drywall
        is one of the most trusted names in the industry.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
