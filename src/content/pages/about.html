      <p class="cs-text">
        In July 1954, Bill McEvoy and his young family made the life-changing
        move from Ireland to the United States. Quickly establishing himself in
        the drywall business, Bill soon founded his own company.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        His son Kieran learned the trade from him and passed it on to his own
        sons. Today, McEvoy & Sons Drywall is a trusted name in the industry.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        We've built a solid reputation over the years, thanks to our careful
        work and strong relationships with customers. We're proud to be a
        third-generation family business, and we hope to serve you for many
