        What an amazing job! Their responsiveness was timely and efficient.
        Their work was above and beyond: clean lines, ready to paint and they
        even found things we missed mentioning during our estimate walk through.

        Kieran was excellent to deal with. Great job on drywall and spackling.
        Skim coated my ceilings and fixed part of my walls that weren’t in the
        quote with no extra charge. Cares about his work. His whole crew was
        great.

        Very professional! I was amazed at the job this company did for me.
        Kieran is very responsive & communicates very well regarding timing of
        job. Work was done to perfection!! The painter that followed him asked
        who was the spackler. It was so nice to hear that he was also impressed.

        I called Kieran to do a small drywall job in my garage and I couldn't be
        happier with the results. He was responsive and great at communicating
        with me throughout the project. His team was excellent and very
        professional. The walls in the garage now look better than those in our
        bedroom!

        One can only hope the reviews are accurate when hiring someone without a
        referral. Kieran McEvoy lived up to the 5 star review. Punctual,
        efficient, professional and beautiful work. More than fair price too. He
        repaired the drywall from a leak I had a while back and installed some
        in a closet where another worker hadn’t finished a job. The pride in his
        work really shows.

        I've used Kieran and Andrew several times for drywall installation and
        skim coating. Let me tell you, skim coating is an art and these men are
        artists. The walls came out beautiful. Their work is done neatly with
        care as if they are working on their own house. The problem is once you
        have some walls refinished by them you'll slowly end up bringing them
        back until all your walls are refinished. They are returning to my home
        again this week.
